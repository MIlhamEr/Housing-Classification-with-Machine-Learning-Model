# Housing Classification with Machine Learning Model üèòÔ∏è
The goal of this project is to test using various machine learning algorithms to classify houses. The dataset was obtained from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/paris-housing-classification/data) and consists of 10,000 data and 18 columns. The dataset includes labeling in the 'category' column, with 8,735 data categorized as basic homes and 1,265 data categorized as luxury homes. The results of this project expect the machine learning model to classify basic and luxury homes based on the features contained in the dataset.
